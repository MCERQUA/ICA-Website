            <h2>Beating Arizona's Heat for Over Two Decades</h2>
            <p>Insulation Contractors of Arizona isn't just another insulation company—we're Arizona natives who understand the unique challenges our extreme climate presents. With over 20 years of specialized experience in the Valley, we've seen firsthand how proper insulation can transform homes from unbearable ovens into comfortable retreats.</p>
            
            <p>Founded and operated by Christopher Kuhn, ICA has built its reputation on one simple principle: <strong>Arizona homes need Arizona solutions</strong>. While other contractors apply one-size-fits-all approaches, we've spent decades perfecting insulation techniques specifically for our desert environment where attics reach 160°F and summer temperatures exceed 120°F.</p>

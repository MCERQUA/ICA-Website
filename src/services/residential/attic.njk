faqItems:
  - question: "How hot do Arizona attics really get?"
    answer: "During summer, Arizona attics regularly reach 150-160¬∞F, creating extreme stress on your cooling system and making upper floors unbearably hot. Proper attic insulation creates a thermal barrier that dramatically reduces heat transfer into your living space."
  - question: "What R-value do I need for my Arizona attic?"
    answer: "The Department of Energy recommends R-38 to R-60 for Arizona attics. However, the type of insulation matters as much as the R-value. We'll assess your specific situation and recommend the optimal solution for your home and budget."
  - question: "Should I remove old insulation before adding new?"
    answer: "It depends on the condition of existing insulation. If it's contaminated, water-damaged, or pest-infested, removal is recommended. Otherwise, we can often add new insulation on top, saving you money while improving performance."
  - question: "How long does attic insulation installation take?"
    answer: "Most attic insulation projects are completed in one day. Larger homes or those requiring old insulation removal may take 2-3 days. We'll provide a detailed timeline during your free assessment."
  - question: "Will new attic insulation really lower my energy bills?"
    answer: "Yes! Our customers typically see 30-50% reductions in cooling costs. In Arizona's extreme climate, proper attic insulation is one of the most cost-effective home improvements you can make."
  - question: "Can I install attic insulation myself?"
    answer: "While possible, DIY installation risks safety hazards, incomplete coverage, and voided warranties. Professional installation ensures proper R-value, air sealing, and safety in Arizona's extreme attic conditions."

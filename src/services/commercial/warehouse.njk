faqs:
  - question: "What's the best insulation for metal warehouses?"
    answer: "Closed-cell spray foam is ideal for metal warehouses as it provides superior R-value, creates a vapor barrier, adds structural strength, and eliminates condensation issues common in metal buildings."
  - question: "How long does warehouse insulation installation take?"
    answer: "Installation time depends on square footage and complexity. Our experienced crews can complete 10,000-15,000 sq ft per day. A typical 50,000 sq ft warehouse takes 3-5 days."
  - question: "Can you insulate an operating warehouse?"
    answer: "Yes, we work with facility managers to insulate in phases, allowing operations to continue. We can work nights, weekends, and coordinate around your inventory and equipment."
  - question: "What energy savings can warehouses expect?"
    answer: "Most warehouses see 30-50% reduction in HVAC costs. Metal buildings often see even higher savings due to spray foam's ability to eliminate air infiltration."
  - question: "Do you handle high-ceiling installations?"
    answer: "Yes, we're equipped for high-ceiling work up to 40+ feet. Our crews are safety-certified and experienced with lift equipment for large warehouse projects."

## The Critical Need for Tank Insulation in Arizona

### Evaporation Crisis

Arizona's extreme conditions create massive water loss:

<div class="evaporation-stats">
  <div class="stat-card">
    <h4 data-text="Uninsulated 10,000 Gallon Tank">Uninsulated 10,000 Gallon Tank</h4>
    <p>Loses <strong>15-25 gallons daily</strong> to evaporation in summer</p>
    <p>Annual loss: <strong>5,475-9,125 gallons</strong></p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="stat-card">
    <h4 data-text="Temperature Impact">Temperature Impact</h4>
    <p>Water temps can reach <strong>95¬∞F+</strong> in uninsulated tanks</p>
    <p>Promotes algae growth and reduces water quality</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="stat-card">
    <h4 data-text="Financial Impact">Financial Impact</h4>
    <p>Water loss costs <strong>$500-$2,000/year</strong> per tank</p>
    <p>Plus increased chemical treatment costs</p>
  </div>
</div>

### Benefits Beyond Water Conservation

- **Livestock Health**: Cooler water encourages consumption, improving animal health
- **Irrigation Efficiency**: Consistent water temperatures improve crop uptake
- **Reduced Maintenance**: Less algae growth means fewer cleanings
- **Chemical Savings**: Stable temperatures reduce treatment needs
- **Energy Savings**: For heated/cooled tanks, insulation cuts energy use by 50%+

## Our Tank Insulation Solution

### Closed-Cell Spray Foam - The Superior Choice

For agricultural tanks, we exclusively use closed-cell spray foam because it provides:

- **Complete Coverage**: Seamless application covers complex tank shapes
- **Moisture Barrier**: Prevents condensation and protects tank materials
- **R-Value 6.5/inch**: Maximum thermal protection in minimal thickness
- **UV Resistance**: With protective coating, withstands Arizona sun
- **25+ Year Lifespan**: One-time investment for decades of savings

## Frequently Asked Questions

<div class="faq-section">
  <div class="accordion-item glass-panel">
    <h3 data-text="How long does tank insulation take?">How long does tank insulation take?</h3>
    <p>Most tanks can be insulated in one day. Larger tanks or multiple tank projects may take 2-3 days. The foam cures quickly, and tanks can be used immediately after application.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="accordion-item glass-panel">
    <h3 data-text="Will the insulation affect water quality?">Will the insulation affect water quality?</h3>
    <p>No. Once cured, closed-cell spray foam is completely inert and safe for potable water applications. It actually improves water quality by reducing temperature and algae growth.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="accordion-item glass-panel">
    <h3 data-text="How long does tank insulation last?">How long does tank insulation last?</h3>
    <p>With proper UV coating, tank insulation lasts 25+ years in Arizona conditions. It's a one-time investment that pays dividends for decades.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="accordion-item glass-panel">
    <h3 data-text="Can you insulate tanks that are currently in use?">Can you insulate tanks that are currently in use?</h3>
    <p>Yes! We can insulate tanks without draining them. The exterior application doesn't affect the water inside, minimizing disruption to your operations.</p>

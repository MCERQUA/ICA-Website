    <h3 data-text="Can you work around our production schedule?">Can you work around our production schedule?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely. We understand downtime costs money. Our crews can work nights, weekends, or during scheduled maintenance windows to minimize disruption to your operations.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="accordion-item glass-panel">
    <h3 data-text="How long does installation take for a typical facility?">How long does installation take for a typical facility?</h3>
    <p>Installation time varies by facility size and complexity. A 20,000 sq ft facility typically takes 3-5 days, while larger facilities may require phased installation over several weeks.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="accordion-item glass-panel">
    <h3 data-text="Will spray foam insulation affect our equipment?">Will spray foam insulation affect our equipment?</h3>
    <p>Our professional installation process includes proper masking and protection of all equipment. The cured foam is inert and won't affect machinery or electronics.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="accordion-item glass-panel">
    <h3 data-text="What about fire safety?">What about fire safety?</h3>
    <p>We use fire-rated spray foam products that meet or exceed building codes. Closed-cell foam can actually improve fire resistance when properly installed with appropriate thermal barriers.</p>

## The Cost of Uninsulated Equipment

### Energy Loss Statistics

In Arizona's extreme climate, uninsulated equipment faces severe efficiency challenges:

<div class="statistics-grid">
  <div class="stat-box">
    <h4 data-text="Bare Steam Pipes">Bare Steam Pipes</h4>
    <p>Lose <strong>85-90%</strong> more heat than properly insulated pipes</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="stat-box">
    <h4 data-text="Uninsulated Valves">Uninsulated Valves</h4>
    <p>Equal to <strong>3-6 feet</strong> of bare pipe in heat loss</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="stat-box">
    <h4 data-text="Tank Heat Loss">Tank Heat Loss</h4>
    <p>Can exceed <strong>$10,000/year</strong> for a single large vessel</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="stat-box">
    <h4 data-text="Chilled Systems">Chilled Systems</h4>
    <p>Gain <strong>15-20%</strong> more heat in Arizona summer</p>
  </div>
</div>

### Safety & Compliance Issues

- **Burn Hazards**: Surface temperatures above 140¬∞F require insulation per OSHA
- **Worker Compensation**: Burn injuries from uninsulated equipment
- **Production Delays**: Equipment too hot to service safely
- **Code Violations**: Energy codes require mechanical insulation

## Equipment Insulation FAQs

<div class="faq-section">
  <div class="accordion-item glass-panel">
    <h3 data-text="How quickly can equipment insulation pay for itself?">How quickly can equipment insulation pay for itself?</h3>
    <p>Most equipment insulation projects achieve ROI within 6-18 months through energy savings alone. High-temperature applications often see payback in under 6 months.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="accordion-item glass-panel">
    <h3 data-text="Can you insulate equipment while it's operating?">Can you insulate equipment while it's operating?</h3>
    <p>Yes, in many cases we can install insulation on operating equipment. Our crews are trained in hot work procedures and safety protocols for live equipment insulation.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="accordion-item glass-panel">
    <h3 data-text="What about outdoor equipment in Arizona's weather?">What about outdoor equipment in Arizona's weather?</h3>
    <p>We use weather-resistant jacketing systems designed for Arizona's extreme UV exposure and monsoon conditions. Aluminum, stainless steel, or PVC jacketing protects the insulation for decades.</p>

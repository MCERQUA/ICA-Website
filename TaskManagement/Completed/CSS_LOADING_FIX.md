Task: Fix CSS rendering issue across all pages

## Issue
All pages were displaying as white containers with no styling because the CSS files were being loaded asynchronously using the preload technique with onload handlers, which wasn't working properly on the Netlify deployment.

## Solution
Updated src/_includes/base.njk to use direct stylesheet links instead of the preload technique:
- Replaced all preload links with direct <link rel="stylesheet"> tags
- Maintained the load order for proper cascade
- Kept the critical inline CSS for FOUC prevention

## Files Modified
- src/_includes/base.njk

## Result
All pages should now display with proper styling, including:
- Dark theme with teal/cyan accents
- Proper typography and spacing
- Grid layouts and components
- Interactive elements
- All visual enhancements

This fix affects ALL pages on the website since base.njk is the master template.

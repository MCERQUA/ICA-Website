# üîç IMAGE VISIBILITY ISSUE - POST-MORTEM ANALYSIS

**Date:** May 31, 2025  
**Duration:** 10+ hours across multiple sessions  
**Status:** ‚úÖ RESOLVED  

## üìã Issue Summary

**Problem:** Images in the "Our Insulation Applications" section were not visible on the live website, despite appearing correctly in the repository and build process.

**User Impact:** Critical homepage content missing, affecting user experience and conversion potential.

**Root Cause:** Aggressive FOUC (Flash of Unstyled Content) prevention CSS was hiding all content with `opacity: 0` until JavaScript loading detection completed.

## üéØ The Real Problem

### Primary Issue: CSS Hiding Content
```css
/* PROBLEMATIC CSS in base-optimized.njk */
.content-section {
    opacity: 0; 
    transition: opacity 0.3s ease-in-out;
    animation: showContent 2.5s ease-in-out forwards;
}

body.loaded .content-section {
    opacity: 1; 
}
```

The insulation applications section had the class `content-section`, causing it to be hidden until JavaScript marked the body as "loaded."

### Secondary Issue: Complex Loading Detection
The JavaScript had 6 different loading detection methods with multiple fallback timers, but in incognito browsers or slow connections, these sometimes failed to fire properly.

## üö´ What DIDN'T Work (Wasted Effort)

### Session 1-3: Image Path Investigation
- ‚ùå Checked image file existence (files were always there)
- ‚ùå Fixed image directory structure (/images vs /images-optimized)
- ‚ùå Updated .eleventy.js configuration
- ‚ùå Consolidated duplicate directories

### Session 4-5: Template Logic Investigation  
- ‚ùå Fixed Nunjucks conditional logic (`showSection !== false`)
- ‚ùå Verified component includes in homepage
- ‚ùå Checked build output structure

### Session 6-8: CSS and Performance Investigation
- ‚ùå Added multiple CSS loading fallbacks
- ‚ùå Implemented image preloading
- ‚ùå Enhanced FOUC prevention with more timers
- ‚ùå Added emergency override JavaScript

## ‚úÖ What ACTUALLY Fixed It

### The Nuclear Solution
**Complete removal of FOUC prevention system:**

```css
/* WORKING SOLUTION */
body { 
    opacity: 1; /* Always visible */
}

img,
.content-section,
.testimonials, 
.service-areas, 
.blog-preview, 
.additional-services,
.site-footer { 
    opacity: 1 !important; 
    visibility: visible !important; 
}
```

**Result:** Images became visible immediately upon page load.

## üß† Key Lessons Learned

### 1. Question Assumptions Early
- **Assumption:** "Images not loading" = file path problem
- **Reality:** Images were loading fine, but CSS was hiding them

### 2. Use Browser Inspection First
- **Wrong approach:** File system investigation
- **Right approach:** DOM inspection to see what's actually rendered

### 3. FOUC Prevention Can Backfire
- Complex loading detection systems can fail in edge cases
- Simple approaches (show everything immediately) are often more reliable
- Performance optimizations shouldn't break core functionality

### 4. Template vs Asset Issues
- Initially diagnosed as template logic error (partly correct)
- But the real issue was CSS hiding rendered content
- Both issues needed fixing for complete resolution

## üîß Technical Details

### Affected Files
- `src/_includes/base-optimized.njk` - Contained problematic FOUC CSS
- `src/_includes/sections/insulation-applications.njk` - Had template logic issue AND path issue

### Fix Commits
1. `cd32c16a` - Fixed Nunjucks template conditional logic
2. `c8a5b54d` - Changed image paths from `/images-optimized/` to `/images/`
3. `70c8007e` - **FINAL FIX:** Removed FOUC prevention CSS entirely

### Browser Behavior
- **Chrome (normal):** Sometimes worked due to faster loading
- **Incognito browsers:** Consistently failed due to stricter caching/loading
- **Slow connections:** Failed due to JavaScript timeout issues

## üìä Investigation Timeline

| Session | Focus | Hours | Result |
|---------|-------|-------|---------|
| 1-2 | Image paths & directories | 3-4 | Failed |
| 3 | Template logic | 2 | Partial success |
| 4-5 | Build configuration | 2-3 | Failed |
| 6-7 | CSS loading & performance | 2-3 | Failed |
| 8 | **DOM inspection approach** | 1 | ‚úÖ SUCCESS |

**Total:** ~10-12 hours of investigation

## üöÄ Prevention Strategies

### For Future Development
1. **Always test in incognito browsers** during development
2. **Use simple CSS approaches** over complex loading systems
3. **Prioritize functionality over performance optimizations**
4. **Check DOM rendering before investigating file systems**

### Code Review Checklist
- [ ] Do all images have `opacity: 1` by default?
- [ ] Are there any CSS rules hiding content until JavaScript loads?
- [ ] Does the site work with JavaScript disabled?
- [ ] Have you tested in incognito/private browsing mode?

### Monitoring
- Set up visual regression testing for critical image sections
- Add browser console monitoring for loading detection failures
- Include incognito browser testing in QA process

## üí° Alternative Solutions (Not Implemented)

### Option A: Fix FOUC Detection
Could have improved the JavaScript loading detection to be more reliable, but this adds complexity.

### Option B: CSS-Only Animations
Could have used pure CSS animations without JavaScript dependency, but still adds unnecessary complexity.

### Option C: Lazy Loading
Could have implemented proper lazy loading for images, but the nuclear approach was simpler and more reliable.

## üéØ Final Notes

**The main lesson:** Sometimes the simplest solution (showing everything immediately) is better than a complex optimization that can fail in edge cases.

**Performance impact:** Removing FOUC prevention may cause a brief flash of unstyled content, but this is preferable to invisible content.

**User experience:** Images are now visible to all users immediately, which is the primary goal.

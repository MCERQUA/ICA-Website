## Overview
This document tracks performance optimizations for insulationcontractorsofarizona.com based on PageSpeed Insights analysis from May 30, 2025.

**Current Performance Score: 74/100**
**Target Performance Score: 90+/100**

## Priority Issues & Solutions

### üî¥ CRITICAL: Text Flashing (FOUC) Issue
**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED (May 30, 2025)
**Issue:** Menu and text content flashing on page load
**Root Cause:** CSS loading after HTML renders, causing Flash of Unstyled Content

**Solutions Implemented:**
- [x] Inline critical CSS in `<head>` section - includes navigation, header, hero styles
- [x] Add font-display: swap to @font-face declarations
- [x] Preload critical fonts with proper preconnect tags
- [x] Add opacity: 0 to body, then fade in after CSS loads
- [x] Extract and inline above-the-fold CSS
- [x] Improved font loading detection with fallback timer
- [x] Google Fonts now loaded immediately after critical CSS

### üî¥ HIGH: Render-Blocking Resources (3.6s delay)
**Status:** ‚è≥ In Progress
**Issue:** Multiple CSS and JS files blocking initial render

**Resources blocking render:**
- netlify.app CSS files (70.7 KiB)
- /css/style.css (15.9 KiB)
- /css/components.css (16.6 KiB)
- /css/animations.css (7.0 KiB)
- /css/performance.css (5.0 KiB)
- /css/forms.css (8.2 KiB)
- /css/layout.css (17.9 KiB)
- Google Fonts (17.8 KiB)

**Solutions:**
- [x] CSS combining logic added to .eleventy.js
- [x] Basic minification implemented
- [ ] Update base.njk to use combined CSS file
- [ ] Remove individual CSS file references
- [ ] Test combined CSS functionality
- [ ] Defer non-critical CSS with media="print" onload="this.media='all'"
- [ ] Use font-display: swap for Google Fonts
- [ ] Preconnect to Google Fonts: `<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">`

### ‚úÖ FIXED: Image Issues (May 30, 2025)
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Issues Found and Fixed:**
1. ‚úÖ Spray Foam Insurance logo - Updated to use optimized version with srcset
2. ‚úÖ Air duct cleaning - Fixed to use -original.webp (specific sizes didn't exist)
3. ‚úÖ Insulation applications - Already using correct optimized versions
4. ‚úÖ Accreditations banner - Confirmed working with all 5 logos scrolling

**Remaining Image Optimization:**
- [ ] Implement better compression for the two PageSpeed-identified images
- [ ] Add proper width/height attributes to all images to prevent CLS

### üü° MEDIUM: Large DOM Size (540 elements)
**Status:** ‚è≥ Not Started
**Issue:** DOM has 540 elements, 24 children in particles div, depth of 13

**Solutions:**
- [ ] Review and simplify DOM structure
- [ ] Remove unnecessary wrapper divs
- [ ] Lazy load sections below the fold
- [ ] Consider virtual scrolling for long lists
- [ ] Reduce particles complexity or lazy load animation

### üü° MEDIUM: Largest Contentful Paint (5.3s)
**Status:** ‚è≥ Not Started
**Issue:** Main content takes too long to render

**Solutions:**
- [ ] Preload hero background image
- [ ] Optimize critical rendering path
- [ ] Remove render-blocking resources
- [ ] Implement resource hints (preload, prefetch)
- [ ] Consider static HTML generation for faster initial paint

### ‚úÖ GOOD: Core Web Vitals
